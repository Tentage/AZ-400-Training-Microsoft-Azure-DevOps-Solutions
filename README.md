# AZ-400 - Training - Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions
Training for Microsoft Official Course (MOC) AZ-400 Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions

<br>

Azure DevOps professionals combine people, process, and technologies to continuously deliver valuable products and services that meet end user needs and business objectives.

<br>

## About the course
In 2020 the course was redesigned to 5 sequential days with 20 modules with the identification ‘**AZ-400T00-A**: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps solutions’

<br>

The Course Outline is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/az-400t00).

<br>

The course content before the reformulation was divided into sub-courses (AZ-400T0X) and these were one or two days which means that it was not mandatory to follow all the sub-courses.
